## YoutubeToMP3
A very simple and straight forward python code that asks for a YouTube URL and downloads it into an mp3 and puts it into your Downloads folder.

# Easiest way to make an environment.

I'd recommend download PyCharm since it's user friendly (link here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)

Once you've downloaded PyCharm, don't open it just yet we'll need it in like 5 minutes. For now we need to make the Python file.

If you have python installed, (download link here: https://www.python.org/downloads) you should have an app called "IDLE" open this app up.
 Once you have it should come up with this:

Press CTRL + S immediately and save it to a location where you'll remember.

Now open up PyCharm and press "New Project"

Press "Create" and then once it's done doing its business (progress bar on bottom bar), drag and drop the .py file you made from IDLE onto the right section.

Once it's done loading the file, press CTRL + A to quickly select all text and press BACKSPACE to delete it all. (We don't need the copyright crap).

Now since PyCharm luckily automatically makes an enviornment, you're going to want to click the 3 layer thing.

Once you have, type in "pydub" and install the top result.
 After you press install, do the same for "ffmpeg", but third result.
  The same with "pytube" but second result, and then finally "audioop-lts" first result.

After it's done downloading all the files, copy and paste the code from this Respoitory.
